        <h2>We Love Him Because He First Loved Us</h2>
        <p>And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him, who have been called according to his purpose.</p>
        <p> Do we love God? Do we keep his commands? The proof that we love God comes when we keep his commandments and they are not at all troublesome.</p>
        <p>God wasn’t attracted to you and didn’t choose you because you were big and important—the fact is, there was almost nothing to you. He did it out of sheer love, keeping the promise he made to your ancestors. God stepped in and mightily bought you back out of that world of slavery.</p>
